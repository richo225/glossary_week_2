# Week 2 Glossary

This is a weekly README file containing information learnt during the week, in this case Object-Oriented-Design (OOP). There were many new concepts introduced and this glossary should hopefully be a helpful reference during the course.

Desriptions for terms will be added in the future

## Projects covered

* Boris-bikes
* Oystercard

## OOP

OOP is the design principle behind manipulating data using objects. These objects can be thought of as nouns and will communicate with one another via messages which can be thought of as verbs. Classes are a way of bundling objects together with specific behaviours. In ruby objects can also have additional behaviours over their class given to them. 

An example. In the boris-bikes project, you make a new object called "station". This will be of the class DockingStation, meaning that "station" and all future stations (ie. all instances of the DockingStation class) will have specific behaviours such as a capacity and the methods dock and release_bike.
